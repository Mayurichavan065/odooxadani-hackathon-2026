## Problem Statement
**GearGuard: The Ultimate Maintenance Tracker**  

**Objective:**  
Develop a maintenance management system that allows a company to track its assets (machines, vehicles, computers) and manage maintenance requests efficiently.  

**Core Philosophy:**  
The system must seamlessly connect **Equipment** (what is broken), **Teams** (who fix it), and **Requests** (the work to be done).

## Project Description
Developed for the **Odoo x Adani University Hackathon 2026**, **GearGuard** is a smart maintenance tracker that helps companies manage assets (machines, vehicles, computers) and maintenance requests efficiently.  

**Core Features:**
- **Equipment Management:** Track all assets by department or employee, assign maintenance teams, and record key details.  
- **Maintenance Teams:** Specialized teams (Mechanics, Electricians, IT) handle requests automatically based on workflow.  
- **Maintenance Requests:** Handle corrective (breakdowns) and preventive (routine) maintenance with scheduling, calendar view, and progress tracking.  

**Smart Features & UX:**
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop stages and overdue indicators  
- Calendar view for preventive maintenance  
- Smart buttons to view requests per equipment  
- Scrap logic for unusable assets  

**Goal:** Streamline maintenance, improve accountability, and provide a clear, intuitive interface for technicians and managers.
